# **ID2203 VT26 Distributed Systems, Advanced Course**

The subject of the course is demanding and requires continuous involvement and focus. A deep understanding of the concepts involves a combination of domain knowledge as well as reasoning skills. [Modules](#modules) are in strict sequential order.

## Modules

1. [Introduction to Distributed Systems](Introduction%20to%20Distributed%20Systems)
2. Foundations
3. Broadcast
4. Consensus
5. Replicated Logs and State Machines
6. Distributed Shared Memory
7. True Time Abstractions
8. Distributed Data Management

## Intended Learning Outcomes

After the course, students shall be able to:

- Know how to specify the properties of distributed algorithms, so called liveness and safety properties.
- Explain the different models of distributed systems, including failure and timing models.
- Master basic algorithms for failure detection, leader elections, broadcast and multicast, basic shared memory in distributed systems, agreement protocols, and group communication.
- Practice in design and implementation of selected distributed algorithms in middleware designed for group communication.

## Course Main Content

- Models of distributed algorithms
- Event-based programming
- Failure detectors and leader elections
- Reliable broadcast and epidemic algorithms
- Shared memory models
- Consensus and agreement
- Group communication and view synchrony
- Stabilization algorithms
- Impossibility proofs
